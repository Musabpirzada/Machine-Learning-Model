<b>Predicting the Boot size by having the input of Harness size of dog.</b>
<h2>Preparing data:</h2>
The first thing we do with a model is load data. We'll cover this in more detail in a later exercise
<h2>Select a model:</h2>
The first thing we must do is select a model. We're just getting started, so we'll start with a very simple model called OLS. This is just a straight line (sometimes called a trendline).
<h2>Train our model</h2>
OLS models have two parameters (a slope and an offset), but these haven't been set in our model yet. We need to train (fit) our model to find these values so that the model can reliably estimate dogs' boot size based on their harness size.
<h2>Use the model</h2>
Now that we've finished training, we can use our model to predict a dog's boot size from their harness size.

For example, by looking at the red line, we can see that that a harness size of 52.5 (x axis) corresponds to a boot size of about 36.5 (y axis).
